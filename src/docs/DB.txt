The main collection is the User collection.
The UserData object has a few properties:

1. UID | the user's unique id

2. username | a string that represents the user's username. Default is an empty string.

3. level | a number that represents the user's current level. Default is 0. 

4. points | a number that represents the user's current points. Default is 0 points.

5. rank | a string to represent what rank the user is in. The default rank is Broze III, then move up from there. Once the user reaches a certain level, update the user rank.

6. nextRank | a string to represent the next rank the user will reach. 

7. joinDate | a string to represent when the user joined. 

8. journalCount | a number to represent how many entries the user has made. 

9. lastActivityDate | a number to represent the last time the user logged in. 

10. profilePicture | a string to represent the url for the user's profile picture. 


----------------------------------------

The user itself has a UID that connects to thier field.
in the same region we start another collection

Below is an example of what this collection would look like

users (collection)
│
├── abc123 (document for a user)
│   ├── uid: "abc123"
│   ├── displayName: "Nathaniel"
│   ├── xp: 240

│       ├── habitId_1 (document)
│       │   ├── title: "Read"
