The habit should 

If the user clicks "complete" the button should not be undone until the next frequency change. I.e. if the user selects daily, it should not change back until 24 hours after the button was pressed, same for weekly, and monthly. 

a user may edit the habit, but by doing so, it resets the habit. 

every successful completion on a habit will earn the user +15 points. 



The Habit Document would look something like this: 

users/{uid}/habits/{habitId}/

{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  frequency: "daily" | "weekly" | "monthly",
  completed: boolean,
  lastCompleted: string,
  streak: number,
  xpReward: number,
  createdAt: string,
  currentCompletions: number
}
