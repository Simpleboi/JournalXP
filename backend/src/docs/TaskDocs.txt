// This is the system design for the Task Service


[The User Creates a new task]
[When the task is created, save it to firestore]

Client (DailyTasks page) creates a draft task and calls saveTaskToServer(newTask).

Client service (taskService.ts) does a fetch("/api/tasks", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify(task) }).

Server route (createTask) reads req.body, validates title, and writes a new Firestore doc with its own fields (ignores client id, createdAt, completed), then returns the created doc data.
