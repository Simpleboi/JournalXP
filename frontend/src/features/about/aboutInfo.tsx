            <br />
            <br />I started working on this project after facing some of the darkest moments of my life. At one point, I nearly lost my own battle with mental health. Tragically, a close friend of
            mine, Jacobe Cook, did lose his life, and his passing became the
            driving force that pushed me to finish this project.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mental health and emotional well-being are deeply important, yet so
            many of us feel alone in our struggles. For a long time, I felt
            stuck in a heavy depression, unsure of how to move forward.
            Journaling became a small but meaningful step toward healing, a way
            to reflect, release, and rediscover myself.
            <br />
            <br />
            I know I'm not the only one walking that path. That's why I
            created{" "}

            track, and even feel proud of, like leveling up in a game.
